# Programming an R Function for Linear Regression
## :star: Purpose
This code consists of a programming exercise that I worked on in the first semester of my M.Sc. studies in [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en). I manually 
construct a function that
- takes the dependent and independent variables as input
- computes the OLS solution using matrix algebra
- presents the results in a well-formatted regression table
